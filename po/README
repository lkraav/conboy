Dear translators,

please note, that the version in trunk is still work
in progress and that I didn't make any efforts yet
to freeze the strings. Also the template.po is not up
to date.

If you're looking for the stable version, this is
currently 0.5.x you can find that in a branch called
conboy_0.5.x.

Thanks for all your work! Hopefully I'll clean up the
strings very soon!

Thanks!
Conny
